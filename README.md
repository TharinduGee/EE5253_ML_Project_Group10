# Diabetes Prediction Based on Health Indicators 

The prevalence of diabetes has been increasing day by day and has urged the necessity of early detection and treatment. In this study, we use machine learning to predict whether a person is having diabetes or not or is in a pre-diabetes condition, based on a set of health indicators using two machine learning algorithms: logistic regression and random forest. Our goal is to determine the best model that would predict the diabetes condition of individuals more accurately. The dataset is preprocessed by incorporating various pre-processing techniques in order to obtain the best accuracy possible. The model performance is measured using performance metrics like F1 score, the area under the ROC curve, and the confusion matrix. The developed predictive models promise unbiasedness and fairness. In conclusion, our work showcases the capability of machine learning in developing predictive models by effectively combining with healthcare and taking preventative healthcare measures.
